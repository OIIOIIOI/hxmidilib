hxmidilib
=========

Haxe port of newgonzo's as3midilib for working with MIDI.

Documentation and samples on the original project's page: http://code.google.com/p/as3midilib/

I just ported it to Haxe and made a couple of fixes (thanks to Captain CAPSLOCK for the help ^^).

Didn't test the receiving of live events yet.
This library could probably be improved further so don't hesitate to contribute!
