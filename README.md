hxmidilib
=========

Haxe port of newgonzo's as3midilib for working with MIDI.

Documentation and samples on the original project's page: http://code.google.com/p/as3midilib/

I just ported it to Haxe and made a couple of fixes.
Thanks to delahee for his contributions as well.

Didn't test the receiving of live events yet.
This library could probably be improved further so don't hesitate to contribute!
